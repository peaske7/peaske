<p>
	I'm <a href="https://github.com/peaske7">peaske</a>, a software developer based in Tokyo.
</p>
<p>
	For the past few years, I worked on fintech services in Japan using Rust and Typescript, that
	handled transactions for millions of users.
</p>
<p>
	Now, I'm working on a startup in Tokyo with my good friend. We're building a new way to think
	about sales calls.
</p>
<p>I like taking <a href="/photos">pictures</a> when I travel as well.</p>
